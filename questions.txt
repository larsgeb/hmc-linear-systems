Inverse data covariance matrix.
    I don't intuitively understand what the meaning is of the off-diagonal elements. On-diagonal elements seem to be
    measurement errors. I see that in the Gaussian it has relevance to the correlation between two quantities, so I assume
    that it has something to do with if one measurement error is large, we expect another quantity to have a large error too.

Volume preservation in phase space using the leapfrog method
    In the leapfrog method, do we need to evaluate the gradient of the misfit at the same point in both the half momentum
    steps to ensure volume preservation? Intuitively I would think so.
