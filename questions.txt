Inverse data covariance matrix.
    I don't intuitively understand what the meaning is of the off-diagonal elements. On-diagonal elements seem to be
    measurement errors. I see that in the Gaussian it has relevance to the correlation between two quantities, so I assume
    that it has something to do with if one measurement error is large, we expect another quantity to have a large error too.

Volume preservation in phase space using the leapfrog method
    In the leapfrog method, do we need to evaluate the gradient of the misfit at the same point in both the half momentum
    steps to ensure volume preservation? Intuitively I would think so.

Assigning moment for Monte Carlo proposal
    Not sure about assigning random moment, now diagonal element of inverse covariance matrix. Correlation could be
    implemented. The physical meaning (within Hamiltonian Mechanics) of this is not immediately clear to me. Some kind of
    connection between particles.
